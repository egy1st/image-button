Hi Mohamed,

 

I’m afraid I’m getting the attached error when running the image Button sample. Do you have any ideas why this is happening?

Hi Paul

I have updated both of Image Button and Form Flipper with a VS2010 Tutorial besides the other VS2008.

I have tested tutorials on both of WinXp and Windows 7. They work fine to me.

For FormFlipper you may get it from http://www.mygoldensoft.com/componentsource/FormFlipper.zip

And for ImageButton you may get it from http://www.mygoldensoft.com/componentsource/ImageButton.zip


Kind Regards,
